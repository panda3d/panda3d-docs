Programming with Panda3D
========================

The Programming with Panda section of the manual attempts to enumerate all the
various functionality that Panda3D provides.

This manual does not attempt to be complete in the sense of listing every
class, function, and method provided by Panda3D. If that's what you're looking
for, go to the `Reference
Section <https://www.panda3d.org/apiref.php?page=classes>`__ instead.

The purpose of this manual is to:

1. List all of Panda3D's broad capabilities,

2. Help you understand what purpose these serve,

3. Give you a general understanding of how to build games in Panda3D.

In time, though, you will need to supplement the knowledge provided by this
manual by studying the `Reference
Section <https://www.panda3d.org/apiref.php?page=classes>`__.
