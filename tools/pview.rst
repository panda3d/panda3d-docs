Previewing 3D Models in Pview
=============================

Pview or Panda Viewer is a model and animation viewer for egg and bam files.
This allows users to see if their files have converted correctly without having
to create a Panda3D program. Pview is accessed through a command prompt.

To view a model that has been converted to an egg or bam file, type the
following::

   pview modelFile.egg

To view a character model with animations, simply add the name of the file with
the animation.

::

   pview modelFile.egg animationFile.egg

Here's an example based on the panda model distributed with panda source.

::

   pview panda.egg

A new window should pop-up and here's what you should see:
