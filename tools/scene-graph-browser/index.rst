The Scene Graph Browser
=======================

The Scene Graph Browser is only available when 'Direct Tools' are enabled.
Information on enabling 'Direct Tools' is available in the
:ref:`Panda Tools <tools>` section.

In the main Direct Session window, there are several scene placement tools
available through the tabs at the right side of the screen. Clicking on these
tabs will bring up a dialog box with the various properties for these aspects.
On the left side of the panel is a collapsible scene graph for the render parent
node. Right click any of the objects to bring up a list of possible commands.

Of particular interest is the placer panel, selected by the place command for
an object. This brings up a separate window that may alter the position,
orientation, and scale for the selected object. A dialog box at the top of the
window allows these movements to be relative to another object in the program.
