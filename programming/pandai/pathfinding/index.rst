Pathfinding
===========

Pathfinding

This deals with the NPC’s ability to calculate the best route between two
traversable points in your Panda3D environment. It requires the creation of a
navigation mesh (see “Navigation Mesh” under "Mesh Generator" page), which is
placed on the surface over which your NPC will be moving. The navigation mesh
allows the system to recognize “traversable nodes” around the mesh, as well as
areas which cannot be traversed (areas occupied by an impediment or obstacle
for instance).

Using the PandAI pathfinding system:

.. code-block:: python

   aiBehaviors.initPathFind(string filename)

This function activates the path finding with A\* for the AI Character.
Filename is the name of the file that is generated by the Mesh Generator
(Covered in the next section of the manual).

(Note: The file is in .csv format)

.. code-block:: python

   aiBehaviors.pathFindTo(NodePath np, string type)

   aiBehaviors.pathFindTo(Vec3 pos, string type)

This function finds the
best path via A\* algorithm (with Binary Heap optimizations) for the AI
Character to reach the target destination and then invokes the path follower
to make the object follow the path.

It can accept both NodePath and Vec3 as input position. NodePath is used when
the destination is not static. Vec3 is used when the destination is going to
be static.

If the AI Character needs to pathfind continuously(say after he has finished
traversing to a position, a new destination is acquired ) then input string
type as “addPath” else leave as default.

.. code-block:: python

   addStaticObstacle(NodePath obstacle);

This function is used if the programmer wants to add Obstacles after the mesh
has been generated (Say a stack of boxes fall down and blocks the way) to
trigger events. It adds a static obstacle to the navigation mesh and pathfinds
around it.

.. code-block:: python

   addDynamicObstacle(NodePath obstacle);

This functions work similar to addStaticObstacle except that in this case the
obstacles can move and are not static. This is more processor heavy so if your
object is not moving, use the prior instead.
