Loading Actors and Animations
=============================

Actor Basics
------------

.. only:: python

   The python class :py:class:`~direct.actor.Actor.Actor` is
   designed to hold an animatable model and a set of animations. Since the Actor
   class inherits from the NodePath class, all NodePath functions are applicable
   to actors.

   Note, however, that Actor is a Python class that extends the C++ NodePath
   class. For the most part, you don't have to think about this: Actor inherits
   sensibly from NodePath and generally does what you expect. There are a few
   subtle oddities, though. When you attach an Actor into a scene graph, the
   low-level C++ Panda constructs only record the NodePath part of the Actor in
   the scene graph, which is fine as long as you also keep a pointer to the Actor
   instance in your Python objects. If you let the Actor destruct, however, its
   visible geometry will remain, but it will cease animating (because it is no
   longer an Actor). Also, even if you keep the Actor object around, if you
   retrieve a new pointer to the Actor from the scene graph (for instance, as
   returned by the collision system), you will get back just an ordinary
   NodePath, not an Actor.

   The Actor interface provides a high-level interface on the low-level Panda
   constructs. In Panda, the low-level node that performs the animation is called
   :class:`~panda3d.core.Character`. You can see the Character node in the scene
   graph when you call :py:meth:`actor.ls() <direct.actor.Actor.Actor.ls>`.

   Do not confuse the Actor class with the
   :ref:`ActorNode <enabling-physics-on-a-node>` class, which is used for
   physics. They are completely unrelated classes with similar names.

   Using Actors
   ------------

   The Actor class must be imported before any loading or manipulation of actors.

   .. code-block:: python

      from direct.actor.Actor import Actor

   Once the model is loaded, the actor object must be constructed, and the model
   and animations must be loaded:

   Loading each animation requires a tuple: the name one is giving the animation
   and the path to the animation. This entire process can be shortened to a
   single command:

   .. code-block:: python

      actor = Actor('Model Path', {
          'Animation Name 1': 'Animation Path 1',
          'Animation Name 2': 'Animation Path 2',
      })

   Note that it is also possible to store the animations and model in the same
   file. In that case, just create the Actor with just the model as parameter.

   When you wish to remove the actor from the scene, you need to call the
   :py:meth:`~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.cleanup()` method.  Note that calling
   :py:meth:`~direct.actor.Actor.Actor.removeNode()` is not sufficient.
   This is due to the fact that Actor is a Python class containing additional
   data that can not be destroyed by the C++
   :meth:`~.NodePath.remove_node()` method.

.. only:: cpp

   The ``Actor`` class which is
   available to python users is not available to C++ users. If you need such a
   class you have to create your own class which at least should do the
   following:

   -  load the Actor Model
   -  load the animations
   -  bind the model and the animations using AnimControl or
      AnimControlCollection

   Required Includes
   '''''''''''''''''

   .. code-block:: cpp

      #include <auto_bind.h>
      #include <animControlCollection.h>

   Load the Actor Model
   ''''''''''''''''''''

   .. code-block:: cpp

      NodePath Actor = window->load_model(window->get_render(), "panda-model");

   Load the Animation
   ''''''''''''''''''

   .. code-block:: cpp

      window->load_model(Actor, "panda-walk");

   Bind the Model and the Animation
   ''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

   .. code-block:: cpp

      // don't use PT or CPT with AnimControlCollection
      AnimControlCollection anim_collection;

      //bind the animations to the model
      auto_bind(Actor.node(), anim_collection);

   Control the Animations
   ''''''''''''''''''''''

   .. code-block:: cpp

      // the name of an animation is preceded in the .egg file with <Bundle>:
      // loop a specific animation
      anim_collection.loop("panda_soft", true);

      // loop all animations
      anim_collection.loop_all(true);

      // play an animation once:
      anim_collection.play("panda_soft");

      // pose
      anim_collection.pose("panda_soft", 5);

   to display names of loaded animations you could
   use:

   .. code-block:: cpp

      for(int n = 0; n < anim_controls.get_num_anims(); ++n)
          cout << anim_controls.get_anim_name(n) << endl;

   If you add more animations to some node after calling:
   ``auto_bind(...)`` they will not be
   controllable until ``auto_bind(...)`` is
   called again with proper arguments.

   Note that it is possible to store the animations and the model in the same
   file.

Although this is a rarely-used technique, it is possible to assemble a
character model out of several separate pieces (separate models). This is
further explained in the section :ref:`multi-part-actors`.

Panda3D supports both skeletal animation and morph animations.

It is also possible to load animations asynchronously, if your build of Panda
has :ref:`threading` enabled.

Panda Filename Syntax
---------------------

The filenames used in the Actor constructor must follow Panda's filename
conventions. See :ref:`loading-models` for more information. Loading actors
and animations utilizes the panda model path, the same as for static models.
