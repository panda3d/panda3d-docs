Networking
==========

Panda3D contains support for networked games. This includes both a low-level
stream based API, and a higher level distributed object API. The documentation
in this section assumes some familiarity with the basic concepts of networking
in general, and the IP protocol in particular.

The documentation on these features is still in development. Read the forums
for the most up-to-date information.
