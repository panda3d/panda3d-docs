Tasks and Event Handling
========================

Tasks are subroutines (functions) that you write that get called by Panda
every frame or every specified amount of time. Event handlers are subroutines
that you write that get called by Panda when certain special events occur.
Together, these two mechanisms enable you to update your Panda world between
rendering steps.
