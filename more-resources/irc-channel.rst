The IRC Channel
===============

The IRC channel is a great place to talk to other developers that use Panda3D,
and to ask questions about anything related to Panda3D.

======= =============================================
Network `Libera Chat <https://libera.chat>`__
======= =============================================
Server  irc.libera.chat
Channel `#panda3d <irc://irc.libera.chat/panda3d>`__
======= =============================================

You need an IRC client to connect to the channel. If you do not have an IRC
client, you can use the web client: https://web.libera.chat/#panda3d

Although you will often get a response fairly quickly, depending on the time of
day and timezone of our users, it may take longer for people to notice your
message and respond. It is recommended that you stay on the channel after asking
your question. Asking whether you may ask a question is pointless.
