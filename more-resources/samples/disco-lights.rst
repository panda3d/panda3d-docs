Explanation

This sample program demonstrates lighting in panda. Lighting in panda can add
a lot of depth into a scene. In panda, you can create point, directional,
ambient and spot lights(for a detailed description of these lights, see the
manual link below). Note that lights in panda will not cast shadows. They can
create a dark and light side of an object but they cannot cast shadows from
one object to another or onto the same object. Panda lights also act on object
vertices only. The more polygons an object has, the more detailed the lighting
will be on it. For more information on lighting, please consult the Panda3D
online manual.
