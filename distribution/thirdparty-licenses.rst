Third-party dependencies and license info
=========================================

License Info
------------

While Panda3D itself uses the Modified BSD license, it brings together many
third-party libraries released under different licenses. This page provides
information on the different libraries and their licenses. Panda3D builds with
some of these libraries by default, however, some of them are linked only into
plug-ins that can be easily removed from the distribution.

Disclaimer
----------

Panda3D takes no responsibility for any act committed using the information
presented here. For legal advice, it is recommended to consult a lawyer.

Building Panda3D
----------------

When building Panda3D yourself on your computer you'll notice that
makepanda.py looks up if you have some libraries installed. On operating
systems with a packaging system, like most GNU/Linux distros have, you'll most
likely find all dependencies as packages in the official repositories.
Otherwise you have to take care of the libraries yourself.

Here you have a list of all third party libraries Panda3D must or can be
compiled against. All of them are optional, but some features of Panda3D
depend on certain libraries being available; omitting certain libraries will
omit the corresponding features from Panda3D.

Recommended Libraries
---------------------

Python
~~~~~~

https://www.python.org/

Panda3D is way easier and faster to code with when using Python bindings.

License: `zlib license <https://www.zlib.net/zlib_license.html>`__

libjpeg
~~~~~~~

https://www.ijg.org/

JPEG library. Required to read and save JPEG files. As of Panda 1.10, Panda3D
will fall back to stb_image for loading .jpg files when building without
libjpeg, but this may not support all JPEG features.

License: libjpeg license

libpng
~~~~~~

http://www.libpng.org

Portable Network Graphics library. Required to read and save PNG files. As of
Panda 1.10, Panda will fall back to stb_image for loading .png files when
building without libpng, but this may not support all PNG features.

OpenSSL
~~~~~~~

https://www.openssl.org/

Provides some networking and encryption support. Required for HTTPClient, and

License: `BSD <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xiph/vorbis/master/COPYING>`__

Freetype
~~~~~~~~

http://freetype.sourceforge.net

Font library. Required to use dynamic fonts such as TTF files. Even without this
library, however, Panda can use static fonts stored in egg files, as generated
by the tool egg-mkfont (however, the tool egg-mkfont itself requires Freetype).

License: `FreeType License <http://freetype.sourceforge.net/FTL.TXT>`__ or
`GPL <http://freetype.sourceforge.net/GPL.TXT>`__

License note: To distribute under a proprietary license, FreeType License must
be chosen instead of GPLv2. Use of FreeType must be acknowledged in product
documentation.

GTK2
~~~~

https://www.gtk.org/

The Gimp ToolKit is used by only by the PStats server on non-Windows platforms.
This is a separate utility that can easily be deleted and is only used when
profiling applications.

same features, including 3D surround sound. We ship the OpenAL Soft
implementation by default on Windows. It can be easily removed from the
distribution.

License: LGPL

Cg Toolkit
~~~~~~~~~~

https://developer.nvidia.com/cg-toolkit

Nvidia's Cg Toolkit is required for Panda's Cg support. At the moment, it cannot
be removed without recompiling Panda3D from source code.

License:

libsquish
~~~~~~~~~

https://code.google.com/archive/p/libsquish/

Libsquish gives DXT support. This improves Panda's support for pre-compressed
texture images such as dds files, and it allows Panda to streamline compression
of textures images at load time. However, even without this library, Panda can
still compress and use compressed textures, by relying on the interfaces built
into your graphics driver.

Patent Restriction Issues
-------------------------

MP3
~~~

patent and licensing, is recommended against. More modern and better suited
audio encodings have been developed and should be used instead.

MPEG
~~~~

Other MPEG related formats are restricted by
`patents <https://www.mpegla.com/>`__ as well. Finding the
prices of licenses for these formats is not even as easy as it was with MP3.

Recommended Alternatives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Free alternatives exist and are highly encouraged. These formats include
`Ogg Vorbis <https://xiph.org/vorbis/>`__ (lossy),
`Opus <https://opus-codec.org>`__ (lossy) and
`Ogg FLAC <https://xiph.org/flac/>`__ (lossless) for audio, and
`Ogg Theora <https://www.theora.org/>`__ for video.
