A Panda3D Hello World Tutorial
==============================

This tutorial is called "A Panda Hello World". It is a typical example of a
simple Panda3D program. Walking through this tutorial will enable you to obtain
some limited familiarity with the Panda3D API without having to learn the entire
thing. The program that we are going to create will load up a small scene
containing some grass and a panda. The panda will be animated to walk back and
forth over the grass.
