General Preparation
===================

You can use multiple programming languages with Panda3D. The most commonly used
language is Python, followed by C++. Some manual pages offer both C++ and Python
information - use the toggle button at the top of the manual page to toggle
between C++ information and Python information.

   Learning Python
   ---------------

   Since Panda3D is a library, and not a point-n-click game maker, it is needed
   to learn Python or C++ before you will be able to use it. Since this engine's
   main goal is to support Python, it would be a good idea to familiarize
   yourself with Python before continuing.

   Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented language comparable to
   Java or Perl. It is available on several platforms, including UNIX, Windows,
   OS/2, and Mac. Python also has a large number of modules outside of the
   standard Python installation, and additional modules can be created in C or
   C++. Because it is late-binding and requires minimal memory management, it is
   an ideal language for rapid prototyping.

   The Copy of Python that comes with Panda
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   On Windows, it is not necessary to install Python, because the Windows
   installer for Panda3D includes a copy. This is a completely normal copy of
   Python, identical to what you would have if you installed Python using the
   standard Python installer. Panda's built-in copy of Python is automatically
   added to the PATH environment variable. This enables you to type "python" at
   the command prompt, and it will run the Python that comes with Panda.

   On macOS, Python 2.7 already comes pre-installed on your system, which will
   work with Panda3D. However, it is recommended to install a newer version of
   Python from https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ .

   What if I already have a copy of Python?
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   If you already have a copy of Python, and you wish to use that instead of the
   one provided with Panda3D, it is easy to do so. Simply create a "panda.pth"
   file inside your copy of Python, containing the path of the panda directory
   and the bin directory within it on separate lines (for example
   C:\\Panda3D-1.10.10-x64 and C:\\Panda3D-1.10.10-x64\\bin).
   This will enable your copy of Python to find the Panda3D libraries.

   For this to work, the version of Python that you use must match the version
   of Python included with Panda3D. The Panda3D libraries are compiled for that
   particular version, and will not work with any other.

   Of course, if you do use your own copy of Python, you may wish to delete
   Panda3D's copy of Python, or at least, remove it from the PATH environment
   variable. Otherwise, you will have two copies of Python, which can lead to
   confusion.

   Python Programming Resources
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   There are a lot of other resources available for programming in Python. Here
   is a list of some of the best:

   Links from the official Python website:

   -  `Current Python Documentation <https://docs.python.org/>`__

   -  `Beginner's Guide from Python's wiki <https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`__

   Learning C++
   ------------

   It is possible to write Panda3D programs using C++. However, since most of
   the documentation uses Python, it may be better to learn Panda3D using Python
   first, and then switch to C++ later. If you do switch, the function calls are
   very similar.

   C++ is an object-oriented high-level multi-purpose language. It is actually a
   copy of the C programming language, but object-oriented, with more functions.
   Here are a few links to C++ tutorials that might be useful for you:

   -  http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/
   -  `www.learncpp.com <https://www.learncpp.com/>`__

   The binaries of the last Windows release are built with Microsoft Visual C++
   2015. If you want to use the provided binaries you can use this version, but
   2017 (and likely 2019) will work as well.

   If you wish to use another version you will have to build Panda from source.
   Note that if you do that you will need all the dependencies (such us libjpeg,
   libpng, etc) built by the same compiler than you are using. You can do this
   yourself or look around for third-party binaries.

   On UNIX-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, you can use the LLVM
   Clang or GNU G++ compiler.

   .. note::

      While many resources for Panda3D are written with Python users in mind, in
      many cases the code can be fairly easily translated to C++. Of particular
      note is the fact that sample code in Python may use the ``camelCase()``
      naming convention for methods, which is not available in the C++ API.
      You will need to translate these to the equivalent ``snake_case()`` names.
